    <p>PM Modi addressed a rally in Bihar in which he once again attacked Congress and accused them of being corrupt. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi submitted his nomination papers for the Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency, a seat held by his mother Sonia Gandhi for two decades. He was joined by Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge, Sonia Gandhi, and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.</p>
    <p>Meanwhile in his X post Rahul said "Nomination from Raebareli was an emotional moment for me! My mother has entrusted me with the family's responsibilities with great confidence and given me the opportunity to serve it. Amethi and Rae Bareli are not different for me, both are my family and I am happy that Kishori Lal ji, who has been serving the area for 40 years, will represent the party from Amethi. In the ongoing fight for justice against injustice, I seek the love and blessings of my loved ones. I am confident that all of you stand with me in this fight to save the Constitution and democracy."</p>
    <p>After weeks of suspense, the Congress on Friday finally declared its candidates for the Amethi and Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituencies of Uttar Pradesh. Rahul Gandhi has been fielded from Rae Bareli while Kishori Lal Sharma will be contesting from Amethi. The Congress, which is contesting 17 Lok Sabha seats in Uttar Pradesh as part of the seat-sharing deal with the Samajwadi Party (SP), had announced candidates for all the seats barring Amethi and Rae Bareli.</p>
