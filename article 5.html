            <h2>Strict visa regulations: Things to remember while applying to study abroad</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\rohit\Desktop\WT DEEPTHI\education.PNG" alt="education in 2024">
            <p>The year 2024 ushered in a series of visa norm changes for international students. Some of these make it difficult for aspiring Indian students to consider their preferred destinations. A strong case in point is the UK which issued new directives for international students, limiting the inclusion of family members starting January 2024. An alternative to this is that students pursue postgraduate degrees to migrate their families to the UK. Most importantly, now a student visa cannot be changed to a work visa in the UK without completing studies.

Almost at the same time, Canada too revised the visa norms for international students. Here, the most significant one was limiting the number of study permits being approved in 2024 to 360,000 only. This is a 35 per cent decrease as compared to the 2023 stats. The cap for 2025 will be decided at the end of 2024. Also, all international students in Canada will need to show they have at least $20,635 (previously $10,000) for their living expenses (this requirement is different for students moving to Quebec).

The US too issued a directive for Indian students wishing to apply for F, M, or J student visas to use information from their passports to set up appointments. This move is aimed at reducing the dreaded immigration fraud. Alongside, Australia also adopted a few stringent measures for all international students, making it mandatory for them to have a minimum IELTS score of 6.0. Like Canada, Australia too hiked the savings mandate for international students. As per the new rules, international students must show savings of at least $24,505, a 17% hike from the previous levels.

Not just the lows, there are highs too
All these may sound like a series of strict measures from the Big 4 (the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia) to curb the number of international students, but all is not lost. I’m happy to share that many emerging destinations such as Ireland, France, Italy, and others have made some relaxations in their visa norms.

The Irish government okayed a two-year post-study visa for international students. Essentially, master’s students can now stay in the country for two more years after completing their degree. The French government rolled out a red carpet for Indian students by offering a five-year Schengen circulation visa for Indian alumni. This is a significant relaxation for the Indian students. Toeing this line, Italy too has allowed Indian students to have temporary residence in Italy for up to one year after their studies to gain professional experience.

International education is impacted by prevailing geo-political developments and mutual relations between two countries. Thus, the change in the norms from time to time, as a former international student myself, I completely understand the uncertainty some of these changes may cause. One of the primary consequences of strict visa regulations is the limited access to educational opportunities for deserving candidates. Many talented students, despite meeting academic requirements, find themselves unable to secure visas due to arbitrary restrictions.

Think fresh, be adaptable and open to change
In times of strict visa policies, I strongly suggest students take several proactive steps to navigate the situation. A few tips for aspiring international students are:

— Stay informed: Keep abreast with the latest visa regulations and updates from relevant government authorities. Information is the key to understand the changing requirements and your education in the chosen destinations may be impacted by these changes.

— Plan early: Plan as early as you can. Start the visa application process well in advance to allow for any unforeseen delays or additional requirements. Early planning can help mitigate the impact of strict policies on your international education plans.

— Seek proper guidance: Consult with trusted immigration experts and advisors. You could also seek guidance from your educational institution, or professionals specialising in immigration laws too. They can provide valuable insights and guidance tailored to your specific situation.

Explore alternative destinations: Research alternative study destinations that may have more favorable visa policies or offer similar academic programs. We just discussed how emerging destinations are going all out to attract Indian students and these should be on your radar too. I suggest considering Germany, Ireland, Italy and France.

— Build a strong application: Focus on strengthening your academic credentials, language proficiency, and relevant experience to enhance your competitiveness as a candidate. A well-rounded application can offset potential concerns related to visa policies.

— Network and collaborate: Reach out to present or former international students who have successfully navigated visa processes in your desired destination. Their insights and experiences can provide valuable advice and support throughout the application journey.

— Stay resilient: Understand that navigating strict visa policies may involve setbacks and challenges along the way. Stay resilient and maintain a positive mindset by focusing on your long-term goals.

By taking proactive measures, seeking support, and remaining adaptable, aspiring students can effectively navigate the complexities of strict visa policies and pursue their academic and professional aspirations abroad.
