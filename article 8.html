            <h2>The Great Indian Kapil Show 6th episode first impression: Deols’ aura is evergreen, but bring back Kapil Sharma’s good old days!</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\rohit\Desktop\WT DEEPTHI\entertinment.PNG" alt="Entertainment news in 2024">
            <p>On Saturday, Kapil Sharma returned with a brand new episode of The Great Indian Kapil Show with guests Sunny Deol and Bobby Deol. Please note that the word ‘new’ won’t be used thereafter as, apart from the Deols, there was nothing ‘new’ in the latest episode. It felt as if Kapil punched in like a bored, reluctant employee, almost on the verge of quitting, and punched out without packing a punch. Too many punches? Writing about stale humour for the 6th consecutive time feels like it.

The show began with a behind-the-scene clip of Kapil and the Deols announcing the new episode. Amid laughter, Kapil humorously remarked, “Tum log edit karlena, pata nahi kya kia hai humne (You guys edit, I don’t know what we have done).” This sentiment appears to be a common thread running through the show.

Kapil Sharma’s crew dove headfirst into a costume extravaganza, channelling the legendary Deol clan in a lacklustre sketch. Krushna Abhishek and Sunil Grover appeared as Dharmendra’s iconic character from Dharam Veer, while Kiku Sharda portrayed Sunny Deol’s character from Jeet and Rajiv Thakur depicted Bobby Deol’s Abrar from Animal. Despite their efforts to sprinkle some spice into the script, the punchlines fell flat, held back by stale writing. But wait! Sunil deserves a special shoutout here as he single-handedly rescued the skit with a pitch-perfect impression of Rajpal Yadav — pure comedy gold!


During the interaction, the Deol brothers were pumped up about the success of their films, Animal and Gadar 2, from last year. They shared some sweet stories from their childhood and joked around like typical siblings. Then, Sunny shared a heartwarming moment as he got teary-eyed talking about his family’s hard work to make a comeback in films.
