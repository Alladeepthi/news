            <h2>ICC Women’s T20 World Cup: India to begin campaign with must-win fixture against New Zealand; Pakistan next</h2>
            <img src="C:\Users\rohit\Desktop\WT DEEPTHI\sports.PNG" alt="sports in 2024">
            <p>Is it better to start a marquee tournament with easier fixtures and ease into big-game mode? Or to play a must-win, tournament-defining fixture right off the bat? India will have to deal with the latter scenario as they start their ICC Women’s T20 World Cup campaign in Bangladesh with a huge match against New Zealand on October 4, in Sylhet.

India, set to be led by Harmanpreet Kaur at the World Cup once more, have been placed in Group A with New Zealand, Pakistan, a qualifier to be determined, and of course, Australia – the most successful side in the history of the tournament. With Australia set to be favourites once again, India can’t afford a slow start and will be expected to hit the ground running against the White Ferns. A defeat will be a big setback for either team in their quest to finish in the top two and reach the semifinals.

India will, on paper, start as favourites alongside Australia in Group A. New Zealand have struggled in recent times, with a 1-4 T20I series loss at home against England highlighting their troubles. But the side has matchwinners in their ranks like captain Sophie Devine and star allrounder Amelia Kerr, more than capable of causing an upset or two, which could be enough to reach the semifinals.
